# vps-net.com/freeCaptcha

HINT: If you find something in this directory you will also find it live at http://vps-net.com/freeCaptcha.

This repository contains the hard-coded and soft-coded content for vps-net.com/freeCaptcha as it sits, live, today. FreeCaptcha is an API, engineered to allow for customized captchas, by way of dynamic font/color/size as well as customizable audible voicing of characters. To see this in action, point your browser to the password reset form on the website, http://vps-net.com/forgot-my-password.htm.

To give it a full test, using the features ingrained, try the following:

For "Random Font" try:
http://vps-net.com/freeCaptcha/?rf=1

For "User Specified font" try, simply replace 1 with any number, up to 68.
http://vps-net.com/freeCaptcha/?uf=1

Some fonts are not installed on the server, hence the blank captcha screens that come up from time to time when running "Random Font".
