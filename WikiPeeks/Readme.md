# vps-net.com/WikiPeeks

HINT: If you find something in this directory you will also find it live at http://vps-net.com/wikipeeks. 

WHAT IS: Wikipeeks?

Wikipeeks was envisioned as a data plugin, which would allow an information system (think website) to take full advantage of all the data that's part of Wikipedia (or other sources, through Wiki feeds). For example, by taking full advantage, a developer could make a website much more attractive to search engine algorithms by lacing responses with contextually relative information, and links, to futher enhance SEO visibility and upward mobility in the spaces of interest. I've since adapted it to take on W3C's (World Wide Web Consortium) Standards and Drafts, to show the versatility in the codebase and approach.

This directory contains the hard-coded and soft-coded content for http://vps-net.com/wikipeeks and https://myvirtualprivate.com/wikipeeks as it sits, live, today. To access it, simply point your browser to either: https://myvirtualprivate.com/wikipeeks.htm, http://vps-net.com/w3c.htm or https://myvirtualprivate.com/w3c.htm.

Note: To execute .htm or .nsp files simply set up you server configuration to handle those extensions as Perl executables, as with all executables you must set their permissions as well: chmod 755.

What is an .nsp or .nsf file? Why do .htm files have Perl code in them? Well, I've been using .nsp and. htm files as Perl scripts on my servers for a very long time, over a decade and a half. NSP is a Netmedia Solutions Program and NSF is Netmedia Solutions File, the latter of which is a simple data file. As just mentioned, on my servers .htm files are executable Perl scripts, whereas .html files are generally static Hypertext Markup files. Netmedia Solutions was my old company name, hence the .nsp and .nsf file extension convention which has stuck around since.

Enjoy.
