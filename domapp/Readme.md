# vps-net.com/domapp

HINT: If you find something in this directory you will also find it live at http://vps-net.com/domapp. The User Interface and User Experience for this application, is unique to my properties, in that its been hardened over time and, in turn, serves as the base for many an application front-end interfacing and user experience. Including FreeDomination, https://MyVirtualPrivate.com/freedomination, which has been hardened even further, seeing as it sits as the newest iteration of this platform.

This repository contains the hard-coded and soft-coded content for vps-net.com/domapp as it sits, live, today. Domapp is a web-based application, engineered to take on a wrapper-based mobile app for iOS and Android. Domapp allos a user to search for a domain name, by any qualified extension, save it and then finalizing it all by registering it with a registrar (Godaddy, 1&1 or Domain.com). Best thing about this application, it saves all your domains in one place. Made it easy to verify all the domain names you want are still available, with one quick action. Come back tomorrow, or a year later, and still have your domain names ready to be verified once again.

Note: To execute .htm or .nsp files simply set up you server configuration to handle those extensions as Perl executables, as with all executables you must set their permissions as well: chmod 755.

What is an .nsp or .nsf file? Why do .htm files have Perl code in them? Well, I've been using .nsp and. htm files as Perl scripts on my servers for a very long time, over a decade and a half. NSP is a Netmedia Solutions Program and NSF is Netmedia Solutions File, the latter of which is a simple data file. As just mentioned, on my servers .htm files are executable Perl scripts, whereas .html files are generally static Hypertext Markup files. Netmedia Solutions was my old company name, hence the .nsp and .nsf file extension convention which has stuck around since.

Enjoy.
