# vps-net.com

Hard-coded content for vps-net.com as it sits, live, today. I'm posting this today for I've redone my servers to distribute non-mission-critical systems to servers isolated from my critical systems. As of now, vps-net.com falls on the non-critical side of the distribution, and as such I feel the need to publish its guts here today. 

And, with that being the case, I can now let people 'take apart' my hard code and methods. Putting the website together back in 2009, through hard-code, long-hours, many design iterations and various engineering changes, was done in order to create this website to be pixel perfect to the UI designs and UX engineering models, as well as functionally viable, for it to work effectively as a marketing tool for its day. 

Keep in mind there are quite a bit of hidden treasures throughout my code, and for that, I am proud. However, for the loose code, logic and lack of comments, well that was all part of the project back then, so not proud of it, but it all definitely worked and for that I am very proud. Keep in mind this was a project not for a client but for myself, my business and my sole and ultimate control.
