# vps-net.com

This repository contains the hard-coded and soft-coded content for vps-net.com as it sits, live, today. I'm posting this today for I've redone my servers to migrate non-essential systems to servers isolated from my mission critical systems. As of now, vps-net.com falls on the non-essential side of the distribution, and as such, I feel the need to publish its guts here.

 Now, I've decided to let people 'take apart' my scripting and programming code as well as my development and design methods. This site was created back in 2009 through hard-code, long hours, many design iterations, and various engineering changes, it may be a bit wild code, but it worked back then and still does a decade later. The purpose was to create a pixel perfect website, when compared to the UI designs, as well as functionally viable from a UX modeling standpoint. There are also other components and applications living within vps-net.com, those will also be published here.
