# vps-net.com

HINT: If you find something in this directory you will also find it live at http://vps-net.com/. For instance, in this directory we have WikiPeeks/w3c.htm, therefore if we want to see that live we'd pull it up in our web browser, http://vps-net.com/WikiPeeks/w3c.htm, like so.

This repository contains the hard-coded and soft-coded content for vps-net.com as it sits, live, today. I'm posting this today for I've redone my servers to migrate non-essential systems to servers isolated from my mission critical systems. As of now, vps-net.com falls on the non-essential side of the distribution, and as such, I feel the need to publish its guts here.

Furthermore, I've decided to let people 'take apart' my scripting and programming code as well as my development and design methods. This site was created back in 2009 through hard-code, long hours, many design iterations, and various engineering changes, it may be a bit wild code, but it worked back then and still does a decade, or longer, later. The purpose was to create a pixel perfect interface, when compared to the UI designs, alongside a functionally viable UX from a modeling standpoint. There are also other components and applications living within vps-net.com, those will also be published here.

One last thing to note: I've been using .nsp and .htm files as Perl on my servers for a very long time, over a decade and a half. NSP is a Netmedia Solutions Program and NSF is Netmedia Solutions File, the latter of which is a flat data file. To run .htm and .nsp programs simply set up you server configuration to handle those extensions as Perl programs. Side note: Netmedia Solutions was my old company name, hence the .nsp and .nsf file extension convention.

Enjoy.
